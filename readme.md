### **Key Features**

- **Coin Flip Animation**: Uses a series of textures (`coin_0` to `coin_6`) to create a realistic flipping effect.
- **Configurable Particle System**: The animation behavior is fully customizable using the Pixi Particles
  Editor â€“ [Pixi Particles Editor](https://pixijs.io/pixi-particles-editor).
- **Memory Efficient**: Ensures efficient resource cleanup to maintain performance.

### **Scope**

- **Coin Visibility**: Coins gradually appear, reach full visibility, perform a series of three vertical flips, and then
  fade out smoothly.
- **Flip Movement**: Each coin performs a simple yet dynamic vertical flip along the Y-axis.
- **Size**: Coins gradually increase in size throughout the animation, enhancing the flipping effect.
- **Positioning**: The animation starts from a central point, with coins scattering outward in all directions.

## **Animation Configuration**

The particle behavior is defined in `CoinShowerConfig.json`, allowing you to adjust:

- Visibility, scale, speed, rotation, and lifespan of each coin
- Coin texture paths
- Emission frequency and overall particle dynamics
